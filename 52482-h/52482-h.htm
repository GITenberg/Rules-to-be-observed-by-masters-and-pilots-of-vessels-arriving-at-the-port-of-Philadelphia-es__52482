  <h2 class='c004'>RULES, &amp;c.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>I. From the first of June to the first of October, in
every year, vessels arriving at the port of Philadelphia,
from any foreign port or place, and every vessel arriving
from any port or place within the United States, at which
port or place the said vessel had only called in or touched
upon her arrival from a foreign port, and vessels sailing
under coasting documents, having on board goods, persons,
baggage, or clothing from any foreign port or place, or any
diseased person, before any of the cargo or baggage
be landed, or any person who came in such vessel shall
leave her, or any person, except the pilot, is suffered to
come on board, (unless imminent danger of the loss of the
vessel or lives of the crew shall render assistance necessary)
shall stop at the Lazaretto, and there submit to the
examination of the Lazaretto Physician and Quarantine
Master.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every vessel of the above description, under one hundred
and fifty tons burthen, will come to anchor as near
the Lazaretto as their draught of water and the weather
will allow; and if of one hundred and fifty tons or upwards,
may either come to anchor near the Lazaretto or in the
outer channel, as near the west end of the island of Tinicum,
opposite the Lazaretto, as her draught of water and
the weather will permitâ€”those preferring to be visited in
the outer channel, will hoist a whiff at the topgallant-mast
head, as a signal for the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>A neglect or refusal to comply with the above, will subject
the person so neglecting or refusing, to a fine of five
hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>II. From the first of October in every year, to the first
of June in the succeeding year, every vessel arriving at the
port of Philadelphia, either directly or indirectly from any
foreign port or place, shall come to anchor in the stream,
opposite the city; and before any of the passengers, crew,
cargo, or baggage are landed, shall receive the visit and
submit to the examination of the Port Physician; and as a
signal for the visit of the said physician, shall hoist a whiff
at the foretopgallant mast head; vessels that arrive in the
day time, will hoist the signal before they arrive at the
lower part of the city, and those that come up in the night,
will hoist the signal before sunrise next morning. <em>Every
captain, pilot, or other person, hauling any vessel to the
wharf, on her arrival as above, and before she is visited by
the port physician, shall for each and every offence forfeit and
pay the sum of two hundred dollars</em>, unless it shall be made
to appear, that there was at the time, imminent danger of
the loss of such vessel, or of the passengers or crew thereof.</p>

<p class='c005'>III. Any master, or other person, on board any vessel,
who shall knowingly deceive, or attempt to deceive the
Lazaretto or Port Physician, or shall make false answers
to their official inquiries, will be liable to a fine of two hundred
dollars, and imprisonment at hard labour for five
years.</p>

<p class='c005'>IV. The certificates of health, granted by the Lazaretto
or Port Physician, are to be presented at the health
office, within twenty-four hours after the arrival and safe
mooring of the vessel at the city under a penalty not exceeding
three hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'>V. Masters of vessels, on presenting their certificates
at the health office, shall pay to the health officer, the following

offence, shall be liable to pay a fine of two hundred dollars.</p>

<p class='c005'>VIII. No pilot, bringing a vessel to the Lazaretto in a
healthy state, shall be obliged to perform quarantine, but
the Lazaretto Physician shall grant such pilot a certificate,
permitting him to proceed to the capes of Delaware, in order
that he may prosecute his profession, but such pilot
shall not, on any pretence, come into the city or adjacent
districts, for twenty days from the date of such certificate,
under the penalty of one hundred dollars, and one year's
imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c009'><em>To an Act, entitled "An act for establishing a
Health Office, and to secure the City and Port
of Philadelphia from the introduction of pestilential
and contagious diseases, and for other
purposes."</em></p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sect. 1.</span> <em>Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in General
Assembly met, and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the
same</em>, That from and after the passing of this act, between
the first day of June and the first day of October, every ship
or vessel coming from any port or place southward of Cape
Fear, bound to Philadelphia, shall be subject to the examination
directed by the fourth section of the act to which this is
a supplement; for every ship or vessel coming from any foreign
port or place, and the master, commander or pilot of
every such ship or vessel coming from any port or place
southward of Cape Fear shall be subject to the same restrictions,
and liable to the same indictment, prosecution and penalties,
as by the said fourth section of the said act is prescribed
for the master, commander or pilot of any ship or
vessel coming from any foreign port or place. And the same
duties shall be performed by the Lazaretto Physician and
Quarantine Master, and the same oaths or affirmations shall
be by them administered, first making known to the person
interrogated the penalty imposed by the said act to which this
is a supplement, which penalty is hereby extended to every
person who shall give false answers, under oath or affirmation,
to the questions proposed under the authority of this act.
And the said Physician and Quarantine Master, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>master or captain of such ship or vessel, shall proceed in the
same manner in all respects as is directed by the said fourth
section of the act to which this is a supplement; and the Board
of Health shall have the same power to determine and direct
what measures shall be pursued, and the same shall be carried
in like manner into execution.</p>

<p class='c005'><span class='sc'>Sect. 2.</span> <em>And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid</em>,
That from and after the passing of this act, between the
first day of June and the first day of October, every ship or

to the port of Philadelphia, and from which ship or vessel
shall have been, within thirty days then next preceding,
unladen, the whole or a part of the cargo or baggage, brought
in the said ship or vessel from some foreign port or place,
every such ship or vessel shall be liable and subject to all the
rules, regulations and restrictions of the said fourth section
of the said act to which this is a supplement, and shall be
examined and treated as well the vessel itself, as the cargo,
crew, passengers and baggage on board, in the same manner
as if such ship or vessel had brought the same cargo, crew,
passengers or baggage, directly from such foreign port or
place, and had the same then on board at the Lazaretto.</p>

fish or hides, shall be unladen at the port of Philadelphia,
until a permit shall be applied for and obtained from
the Board of Health. And if any master, captain, owner or
owners, consignee or consignees, or other persons, shall presume
to unlade from on board of any such ship or vessel, any
vegetables, fish or hides, without first having applied for and
obtained a permit from the Board of Health, every such master,

other person, so offending, shall pay a fine not exceeding
five hundred dollars, to be recovered and appropriated as is

the captain or master, owner or owners, consignee or consignees,
and other person, having the direction of the discharge
of the same, under the penalty of one hundred dollars,
to be recovered and appropriated as by the act to which this
is a supplement is directed, to give, or cause to be given, to
the Board of Health, notice that the same cargo is discharged,
and to permit and suffer the Board of Health, by themselves
or by their lawful agent by them for that purpose appointed,
to examine the condition of the hold, ballast and limbers of
such ship or vessel. And if the Board of Health shall deem
it for the safety and health of the city of Philadelphia, they
are hereby authorised and empowered to designate a proper
place to which the said ship or vessel shall be taken, and that
her hold, ballast and limbers shall there be cleansed and purified,
or at the expense of such captain or master, owner or
owners, consignee or consignees, or other person, having the
direction of the discharge of the cargo, to send, or cause to
be sent, such ship or vessel to a proper place, and have her
hold, ballast and limbers cleansed and purified.</p>

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
